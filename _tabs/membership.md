## How to become a member

After attending four (4) meetings, you have the opportunity to become a full-fledged member. This discounts the cost of attending meetings to member-rate club dues.

## Maintaining member status

You may maintain your member status for one year without attending meetings. You do not have to pay for meetings you miss unless you have paid up front. We have a no refund policy.
